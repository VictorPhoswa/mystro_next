# mystro_next
Hi! 

I developed a Mystro_next clone not fully functional, however implements most of all the important functionalities like Navigation of screens, Permission enabling, OAuth2.0 Uber authentication linking and toogling the availability status. I excluded some Icons, due to no better icons found and data fetching due to time.

Application developed: Mystro_next clone
